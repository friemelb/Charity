			<br><h3>What I’m doing</h3>
I am running the Austin Marathon on February 16th. This is not my first marathon, but I am going for a 3:50 time. This ends up breaking down to about a 8:45 minute pace for 26.2 miles. 
<br><br><h3>Why</h3>
I am raising money for Special Olympics of Texas. The mission of Special Olympics Texas is to provide year-round sports training and athletic competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for children and adults with intellectual disabilities, giving them continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy and participate in the sharing of gifts, skills and friendship with their families, other Special Olympics athletes and the community. This cause is very special to me. I did a fire truck pull to support Special Olympics of Texas and saw how much they enjoyed doing it. From that I really saw the value of this charity. It really makes them happy and gives them confidence.

			<br><h3>Goal</h3>
My initial goal is $500, but we do not have to stop there. I’m planning some stretch goals for $750 and $1000. If anyone is interested in making a special donation and would like their name, someone they know, or a company name on me while I’m running email, tweet, or facebook message me. I will be making a shirt that has the name of everyone who wants to be on it. 
<br><br><h3>Deadline</h3>
The deadline for fundraising is February 16th, also that is the day of my marathon. If you are thinking about being on my shirt, you will have to get your donation in 3 weeks before the deadline.

<br><h3>Closing</h3>
I want to thank each and every one of you for you for the support. All of the money is going to a wonderful cause and all of the encouragement is truly appreciated.  This wouldn’t be possible without all the amazing people helping.
